;;; Commentary:

;; Display recently modified files at the beginning of Ido's file list.
;;
;; To activate after installing, add to ~/.emacs:
;;   (ido-sort-mtime-mode 1)
;;
;; To display TRAMP files before local ones, use:
;;   (setq ido-sort-mtime-tramp-files-at-end nil)
;; (Checking modification time for TRAMP files is not yet supported.)
;;
;; See also: M-x customize-group RET ido-sort-mtime RET

;;; Code:
